This project aims to perform some exploratory analysis of various Socioeconomic and financial risk parameters for different countries.

By visually representing and examining these risk indices, we can determine which countries are lacking in which regard in terms of per-capita income, and freedom of the press, to name a few.

By performing exploratory data analysis, we aim to gain insight into the following questions:

Q1 In which countries do the top 1% hold almost all of the countries' wealth?

Q2 Accessibility and electricity consumption serve as an essential benchmarks for economic progress. Thus, which countries have ensured easy access to electric power?

Q3 Bad loans/Non-performing assets of a country's public and private banks can be detrimental to the flow of credit in the economy. Thus, which countries have accumulated a lot of GNPA (Gross Non-Performing assets) 

Q4 Is there a positive correlation between GNPA and government corruption?
